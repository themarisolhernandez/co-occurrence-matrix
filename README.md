# Objective

Sometimes we think we find the holy grail, that one piece of literature that perfectly supports our research. As you skim the paper, you find yourself begging for more. What else is out there? There has to be other related work out there. A great place to start when looking for related literature is to look at the resources cited in the bibliography. I said "great," but is it really?

There has to be another way, a more efficient, appealing, user-friendly solution.

Introducing the similarity matrix. I went to work and developed a matrix diagram that visualizes overlapping topics in a sample of dissertations from my University. Each colored cell represents two published works and their similiarities; the darker the color, the greater the similarity.

In doing so, I had two main jobs: **get the data** and **build the d3 visualization**.
